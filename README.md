# CanisHackaton202311

Through this project, we wanted to raise awareness on the potential impact of Chinese state-run social media accounts.

We explored and visualized the given dataset from two angles:
1. Number of Chinese state-run social media accounts
2. Number of subscribers / followers to these accounts

## Built with ##
- Python Jupyter Notebook files included here used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and wrangling

ExploreDataSet.ipynb:
- We splitted the dataset into 6 datasets containing subscriber numbers for each of the 6 social media platforms
- Exported 6 different csv files

ToNetworkGraph.ipnyb;
- We also wrangled the data from listing the platforms horizontally to making them into vertical rows. Each one of the platform entry will become a row.
- Exported 1 csv file containing subscriber data for all platforms all in one column and another extra column for the platform name that the subscriber is belonged to.

## Visualization ##
- csv files from the above was imported into Power BI
- All visualization was done using Power BI.

## Final Results ##
